\section{Introduction}
The following will explain how a VOCS (Variable Offset Cumulative Spectra) experiment can be processed in ssNake. The
tutorial delivered with the ssNake program is considered as prior knowledge. If you have not yet
studied this, please do so before continuing with this example.

When encountering very broad signals in solid state NMR, issues arise with proper excitation and
measuring. As the broad signal decays very fast in the time domain (FID), an echo is required to
properly measure it. The width of the spectrum that can be covered by these echo pulse is however
limited by the RF power. In cases with really broad signals, a regular probe cannot reach an RF
power high enough to excite the whole spectrum in one go.

To counter this problem, the VOCS experiment has been developed. The idea is simple: echo spectra
are recorded for several different offsets (carrier frequencies)  and added afterwards. While each
experiment only excites a small part, the whole spectrum can be reconstructed as long as we have
several echo spectra with offset values across the broad line. Processing the data can be
cumbersome, but is in principal easy.

\section{Used data}
For this example, we will use a set of $^{127}$I spectra of methylammonium iodide (MAI) recorded at 20~T.
21 echos were recorded with 100 kHz steps in the offset (carrier frequency). The spectrum is very
broad due to the strong quadrupolar coupling. The lineshape is only of the central transition, and
is dominated by the second order quadrupolar coupling.

In the data directory, 21 different spectra are saved as MATLAB files (saved with ssNake). The 'Raw'
folder contains the measured FID from the Varian spectrometer. The `FinalSpectrum' folder contains
the final spectrum of this tutorial.

\section{Processing}
In the data directory, 21 different spectra are saved as MATLAB files. The saved spectra contain the
processed echo spectra. These have been made using whole echo processing (see our other tutorial).
The center frequencies has been put right (necessary because I recorded the data as an array,
instead of the better option to take spectra 1D spectra), and the data have been cut to only show
the relevant area (we do not want to add all the noise to the left and right of every echo).

\begin{itemize}
\item Open the data in ssNake by dragging and dropping all of them in ssNake (or via File
  $\longrightarrow$ Open).
\end{itemize}
This gives us all the separate echoes in different workspaces. To preview the data, lets view them
together in a Multiplot. When in '-100', use Plot $\longrightarrow$ Multiplot to go to the multiplot
window. Use the `Add spectrum' button in the side frame to add some other echos, and reset the
spectrum view by double right click in the spectrum. I added -1000, -700, -400, 200 and 600 to get
this view:

\end{center}

We can already see a hint of the spectrum the we want to get (spoiler alert: it has $\eta=0$).

The actual tricky part is the adding of the data: each echo has its own $x$-axis, and we can not
just add the data. We first must force all the spectra to use the same $x$-axis. This is called
`regridding'. In a regridding procedure, a new $x$-axis is constructed. Then, for each $x$-value, a
$y$-value needs to be determined. This can be done by interpolation using the $y$-values that are in
the measured spectrum. This results in a new data set with the new axis $x$ and the approximated
$y$-values. All the new $x$-values that are outside the range of the old axis get $y$-values of 0
attached to them (no \textit{extra}polation is performed).

We need to apply the same regridding on all of our 21 spectra. Based on the figure above, a range of
$-500$ to 1500 kHz seems appropriate. We also have to chose a number of points. It is good to make
this around the same density (number of points per kHz) as our single echoes. This appear to be 1.6
per kHz, so lets make it 2 and go for 4k points (4096 points). 


\begin{itemize}
\item Go to workspace `-100' 
 \item Execute Matrix $\longrightarrow$ Regrid (min: -500, max: 1500, points 4096).
\end{itemize}

This gives to following Figure:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figs/Fig2.png}
\end{center}
We now have to do this for all the workspaces. This is most easily done by using a macro. Go to
workspace `-200' and go to Menu Macros $\longrightarrow$ Start recording and push OK for the name.
Then do the same regridding as before (min: -500, max: 1500, points 4096). The go to Macros
$\longrightarrow$ Stop recording. The macro can now be used via Macros $\longrightarrow$ Run
$\longrightarrow$ MacroName. Run the macro over all the other workspaces to do the regridding for
all 21 spectra.

As a final step, we have to add all the spectra. This can be most conveniently done by merging the
data to a 2D data set. Use Combine $\longrightarrow$ Combine Workspaces and select all entries on
the left (use ctrl + a), and drag them to the right. Push OK, and give it a nice name. This creates
a 2D data set, with the different spectra along D1. To view this, use Plot $\longrightarrow$ Stack
plot, and set the `Spacing' to zero (in the side frame). This gives:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figs/Fig3.png}
\end{center}

Which shows all the different spectra overlaid. As a final step, we need to sum the data over D1:
\begin{itemize}
\item Go to a 1D plot (Plot $\longrightarrow$ 1D Plot)
\item Change the active dimension to D1 (click on the radio button under `D1' in the side frame)
\item Use Matrix $\longrightarrow$ Region $\longrightarrow$ Sum (with no input parameters, just push
  Ok)
\end{itemize}
This should give:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figs/Fig4.png}
\end{center}
Which is the final spectrum. A beautiful $\eta = 0$ second order quadrupolar pattern. It does
exactly not conform to simulations, as the probe tuning was not changed during the experiment. This
lowers the intensity far away from the centre.
